Test daemon build nudge mechanism (attempt 4)

This change validates the end-to-end nudging flow after the pipeline fixes in bpfman-operator PR #1097.

Expected flow:
1. Daemon builds trigger with this change
2. Daemon nudges operator via hack/konflux/images/bpfman.txt
3. Operator rebuilds
4. Operator nudges bundle via hack/konflux/images/bpfman-operator.txt
5. Bundle rebuilds
6. Snapshot created with consistent component versions
