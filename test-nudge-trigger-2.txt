This is a test file to trigger daemon builds after PR #326 merged.

The builds need to pick up the hermetic: 'false' parameter that was
added in PR #326 to satisfy Enterprise Contract policy requirements.

Previous builds were failing EC validation with:
  Violation: hermetic_task.hermetic
  Reason: Task 'buildah-remote-oci-ta' was not invoked with the hermetic parameter set

This dummy commit should trigger fresh daemon builds with the correct
parameters.
