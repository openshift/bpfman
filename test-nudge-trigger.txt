This file exists solely to trigger a daemon build and test the nudge
mechanism after fixing the bpfman-daemon-ystream component configuration.

Expected flow:
1. This commit triggers daemon build
2. Daemon build completes and nudges bpfman-operator-bundle-ystream
3. Nudge PR created updating hack/konflux/images/bpfman.txt in bpfman-operator repo
4. Nudge PR merges
5. Bundle pipeline triggers (validating the CEL expression fix)
6. Bundle rebuilds with updated ConfigMap
